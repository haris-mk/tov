In this work, I'm solving Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to construct a static non-rotating neutron star with a description of equation of state which could be either piecewise polytropic or, provided as table. 

## To Do:
* add thermodynamimc consistent interpolation of EOS tables. 
* add numerical error in maximum mass and interpolation error. 
* Include rotation profile to the neutron stars
* Make code faster
* Make julia code;

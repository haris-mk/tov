In this work, I'm solving Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to construct a static non-rotating neutron star with a description of equation of state which could be either piecewise polytropic or, provided as table. 

Imported from natj <nattila.joonas@gmail.com>; https://github.com/natj/tov on **7.Dec.2017** after which these additions have been made: 
1. surface finding algorithm
2. EOS table format with interpolation
3. calculation of tidal deformability

## To Do:
* add thermodynamimc consistent interpolation of EOS tables. 
* add numerical error in maximum mass and interpolation error. 
* Include rotation profile to the neutron stars
* Make code faster
* Make julia code;
